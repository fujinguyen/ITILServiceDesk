ServiceDesk
===========
This is a fork from www.adefhelpdesk.com.

Summary of changes

The project was converted from WSP to WAP model for easy check in/out

The UI is styled with Bootstrap 3.0 to explore Responsive design.  Why not have one set of code to display content on on desktop, tablet and phone?

It will require DotNetNuke skin compatible with Bootstrap 3.0 to work.  One such skin can be found at  http://www.christoc.com/Products/HammerFlex.

WARNING - This is not an upgrade to adelhelddesk module.  This is an experiment of using Bootstrap in DotNetNuke custom module and it should not be used in produciton at this time.
